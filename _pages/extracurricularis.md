# The Physical Model: Volleyball 🏐
Being part of my university’s volleyball team is one of my most cherished memories from undergraduate life. Through countless practices and competitions, I experienced the excitement of high-level play and the deep sense of trust and camaraderie that comes from working closely with a team. Volleyball taught me the joy of collective effort, the discipline of training, and the power of shared goals—lessons that continue to shape how I approach collaboration today.

## The Training Set

Our team’s training routine was as exhausting as it was unforgettable. Because our department was located an hour and a half from the main campus, every practice began with a long bus ride to the main gym and ended with us paying out of pocket for a late-night taxi back—often arriving around 10 p.m. We would complain about the fatigue during the ride, only to be scolded by the dorm supervisor when we finally returned. Yet despite the long commutes, the late nights, and the constant tiredness, these moments became some of my favorite memories—shared struggles that brought us closer and made the experience truly special.

I feel incredibly fortunate that every tournament I competed in during [**2023**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI2MjA5MzUxMQ==&mid=2652102263&idx=1&sn=3acce423eea0f0cf38c4c7aa6da89ad1&chksm=f1b711dfc6c098c92c9812349c2629330b89fe6ca30878f7a3d821d8621cc9400c6e9ce6771e&scene=27) and [**2024**](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI2MjA5MzUxMQ==&mid=2652109909&idx=2&sn=7560d7744c68f69b7ba5c512079af496&chksm=f0a93f7bb5fa922084f37cfdc960c2379e3a2ae8c17c9e6d8dc5c7dcff23c38ff1dedfea086d&scene=27) ended with a championship title—including back-to-back victories in the Liaoning Provincial University Volleyball Championships. Looking back, I’m filled with gratitude for the opportunity to compete at that level and for the teammates and coaches who made those achievements possible. Winning was unforgettable, but what stays with me even more is the feeling of being surrounded by people who pushed, supported, and believed in me every step of the way.
