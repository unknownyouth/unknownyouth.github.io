Welcome! I am Zhejun Yu, a Master’s student in Computer Science at Duke University. My work centers on large language models, intelligent agents, and the design of trustworthy AI systems. I am broadly motivated by building reliable and scalable LLM applications that address real-world challenges.

My current research focuses on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), structured tool-use, and adaptive decision-making. I enjoy working at the intersection of algorithmic design, system engineering, and practical deployment, and I am particularly interested in developing agents that can autonomously plan, interact, and learn from complex environments.

I am currently seeking **Summer 2026 internship opportunities** in LLM applications and agent systems, where I can contribute to building the next generation of intelligent and robust AI systems.
