title: "Research and Implementation of Deep Learning-based Image Captioning"
excerpt: "By adopting an encoder-decoder architecture , my study develops a Transformer-based model utilizing
Vision Transformer (ViT) or Swin Transformer as the visual encoder and GPT-2 as the language decoder. 
To address high computational demands, the research further implements Smallcap, a lightweight model that leverages frozen parameters and retrieval-augmented strategies to balance efficiency with high performance. <br/><img src='/images/model_architecture.png'>"
